# etl-with-airflow-and-pyspark
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline designed to process and analyze customer reviews from an e-commerce platform. The pipeline uses PySpark for data transformation, AWS services (S3, Redshift) for storage, and Apache Airflow for orchestration. The data is containerized with Docker for portability.
